"""Turn-end forced-decision guard for the tool-gated reply gate.

This module is intentionally policy-only. It never delivers a message itself;
it turns the passive "undecided" outcome (see ``gateway/run.py``'s reply-gate
telemetry) into a bounded follow-up when the model tries to finish a
tool-gated group/DM turn without ever calling ``send_message(target="current",
...)`` to reply or ``send_message(target="current", action="silent")`` to
explicitly decide silence.

Why this exists (CONFIRMED real casualty, 2026-07-11, group "Quetzalogic -
Hal"): the reply-gate redesign shipped 2026-07-09 correctly stopped
auto-delivering a substantive-looking free-text tail when the model never
decided — but "correctly suppressed" and "actually delivered a real answer"
are different outcomes, and the redesign had no mechanism to push the model
toward the latter. A user asked a real technical question; the agent did 11
tool calls of real investigation and wrote a complete, correct, 1260-char
answer ending in a direct question back to the user — then simply never
called ``send_message``. The turn ended, logged ``outcome=undecided``, and
the answer was silently discarded. The user explicitly said afterward: "I
actually asked for you to FORCE an answer[,] a decision." This module is that
force: mirrors ``agent/verification_stop.py``'s proven pattern (a synthetic
user-role nudge that holds the tool-calling loop open for one more round when
a real condition is unmet), applied to "did the model decide?" instead of
"did the model verify?".

Bounded and fails open: capped attempts (default 2, config
``agent.max_reply_decision_nudges``), and if the model still doesn't decide
after nudging, the ORIGINAL gateway suppression (log ``outcome=undecided``,
no delivery) is the final fallback — this module cannot regress to "always
deliver" behavior, it can only reduce how often "undecided" actually fires by
giving the model more chances to make the explicit call before the turn ends.
