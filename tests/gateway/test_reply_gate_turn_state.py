"""Reply-gate v2: TurnDeliveryState is the identity-stable per-inbound-message
delivery ledger that fixes the ~44% counter-miss rate of the v1 per-source
counters.

ROOT CAUSE (measured 2026-07-13, WhatsApp group "TAMHAL Y JVic"): a single
inbound message's turn can span MULTIPLE _run_agent_inner invocations (the
re-entrant queued-follow-up chain), and each recursive run (a) reset the
source counters and (b) bound a DIFFERENT `next_source` object than the outer
post-turn block reads. A send_message(target="current") firing in a follow-up
run incremented a source object the gateway never inspected, so the reply-gate
saw tool_sends=0 and either double-sent a free-text tail or (before the
transcript-scan safety net) dropped a decision. The forced-decision nudge, which
also read the per-source counters, never fired once in the entire burn-in.

FIX: one TurnDeliveryState created at the OUTER per-inbound-message scope,
bound to a contextvar for the whole (re-entrant) chain, mutated in place by the
send_message tool (attribute writes survive the executor-thread -> asyncio-loop
boundary), read by identity by both the post-turn dedup block and the nudge.

These tests lock the invariant that made v1 fail: a send under a DIFFERENT
source object, on a worker thread, in a follow-up run, must still be visible to
the outer scope via the single shared TurnDeliveryState.
