"""Regression: the reply-gate free-text tail must be deduped when a
send_message(target="current") already delivered this turn, even if the
turn-scoped reply_gate_tool_sends counter reads 0.

CONFIRMED production leak (2026-07-12, WhatsApp family group "TAMHAL Y JVic",
JID 120363408837480763@g.us): the model correctly replied to a batch of
photos by calling send_message(target="current", message="¡Ayyy, quedaron
buenísimas...") which delivered successfully (DB msg 199272 tool_call ->
199274 result {"success": true, ..., "mirrored": true}), then emitted a
trailing status narration "Enviado. ✅ Comenté las fotos de las escaleras..."
The reply-gate logged `tool_sends=0 outcome=undecided_delivered` and
double-sent that "Enviado ✅" tail into the family group as a second message.

The dedup guard (gateway/run.py: `if _delivered_via_tool: suppress`) exists
and its unit tests pass — but it keyed SOLELY on the turn-scoped
`source.reply_gate_tool_sends` counter, incremented by
tools/approval.py::note_current_message_delivered() inside the tool-executor
worker thread. That counter read back as 0 at the post-turn delivery
decision despite the transcript proving the send succeeded (a
thread/context-boundary fragility that reproduces only under the real
concurrent/coalesced-image turn conditions, not in the isolated unit test).

Fix: gateway/run.py::_transcript_has_current_chat_send() scans the actual
turn transcript for a successful send_message tool result as a
defense-in-depth dedup signal, OR-ed with the counter. The transcript is
ground truth; a live turn can only send with target="current" (the
live-turn scope guard refuses explicit cross-target sends mid-turn), so any
successful send_message result in a live turn is necessarily a current-chat
delivery and safe to dedup against.

These tests lock the transcript-scan helper's behavior so the double-send
class cannot silently regress.

# received the FULL retained conversation (not just this turn's tail), it
