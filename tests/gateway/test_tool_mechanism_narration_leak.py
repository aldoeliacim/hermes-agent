"""Leaked tool/mechanism meta-commentary detection (gateway/response_filters.py).

CONFIRMED real casualty (2026-07-11, "TAMHAL Y JVic" WhatsApp group, TWICE
within 5 minutes): under the fail-loud undecided_delivered path, the model
wrote out its own confusion about tool availability as the final response
text instead of answering "De camino"/"En mi casa" — and fail-loud dutifully
delivered that verbatim to a family group. These tests lock in the detector
that prevents that specific leak class from recurring, while proving it
never suppresses a genuine on-topic reply that happens to mention tools.
